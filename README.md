# Survey Form

## Description
This Survey Form is a web-based project created as the final assignment to earn a certification in HTML5 and CSS from FreeCodeCamp. It features various form elements including text inputs, radio buttons, checkboxes, and dropdown menus, designed to gather user feedback on FreeCodeCamp's offerings.

## Learning
While creating this page, I learned advanced HTML and CSS techniques. This included form design, responsive layout, and creating interactive elements. It was a significant opportunity to apply theoretical knowledge in a practical scenario, enhancing my understanding of web development fundamentals.

## Overview
The Survey Form includes several sections:
- User Information: Collects basic details like name, email, and age.
- Current Role: A dropdown menu asking about the user's occupation.
- Feedback on FreeCodeCamp: Radio buttons to gauge whether users would recommend FreeCodeCamp.
- Favorite Features: A dropdown to select what users like most about FreeCodeCamp.
- Improvement Suggestions: Checkboxes for users to indicate areas they feel need enhancement.

All these elements are intuitively designed for user engagement and efficient data collection.
